# Aleksan Alta — Cybersecurity Portfolio

Computer science student building skills in cybersecurity, networking, and defensive security.  
This site documents hands-on labs, notes, and projects as I develop practical experience.

## What I’m Working On
- Networking fundamentals (routing, switching, TCP/IP)
- CompTIA Network+ preparation
- Introductory security labs and tooling

## Planned Projects
The following projects will be added as they are completed and documented:
- Network lab documentation (VLANs, subnetting, traffic analysis)
- Packet capture and analysis (Wireshark)
- Basic threat modeling and detection concepts

## Why This Repository Exists
This repository serves as a public record of my learning and applied work in cybersecurity.

> Status: Actively building — content will be added continuously.
